    <h3>The Hunger Games</h3>
    <p> Katniss Everdeen is the protaganist in 
    <a href="https://thehungergames.fandom.com/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen">The Hunger Games</a>
    , which tells the story of a 16 year old girl living in the dystopian aftermath of North America â€“ Panem. 
    The nation of Panem consists of twelve districts, each specializing in a different field 
    (e.g. coal, lumbar, agriculture, etc.). Panem hosts annual "Hunger Games" 
    as punishment and a reminder to the people of what happens when the districts rebel against the Capitol.
    During the reaping of the 74th annual Hungar Games, a mandatory event in which one boy and
    one girl is selected from each district to participate in the Hunger Games, Katnis's little sister
    is picked. Katniss decides to volunteer in place of her little sister Primrose and is joined by the
    local baker's son -- Peeta. The two fight are sent to an arena where all the selected tributes will
    fight to the death until there's one last victor standing. However, Katniss and Peeta are the last two
    standing, and in an unprecedented outcome, the Capital decides to crown both Katniss and Peeta victors.
    There's much more to the story and Katniss's attributes but I got lazy to write them out. Check out the 
    Hunger Games link to learn more.

        <li>She was able to one-up the Capital every time</li>
